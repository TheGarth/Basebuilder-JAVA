# Basebuilder-JAVA
Trying to learn me some Java and get back into hobbyist programming/game-dev.  Goal:  Build a Rimworld-esqe base builder.

Initial Ideas:

Instead of a Gods-Eye command, give the player a "Boots-on-the-ground" experience by giving them direct control of one colonist.  They can flag areas to be worked by other colonists, but can also do work directly.  (Later game items may enable the standard gods-eye perspective, such a planning documents/planning computer.)
